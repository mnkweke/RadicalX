# Project Name: Prognosis Predictor

## Description
This project aims to predict health diagnoses based on symptoms using various machine learning models. The dataset comprises various symptoms and corresponding diagnoses, and multiple classification algorithms were employed to predict the diagnosis based on the given symptoms.

This project was developed during the RadicalX Hackathon to create an efficient health diagnosis prediction system.

## Features
- Utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree for health diagnosis prediction.
- Handles data preprocessing steps including handling missing values, label encoding, and duplicate removal.
- Evaluates and compares the performance of each model using cross-validation techniques.
- Implements hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Addresses overfitting issues through regularization techniques.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
